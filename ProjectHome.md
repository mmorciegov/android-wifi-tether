This program enables tethering (via **wifi**) for "rooted" handsets running android (such as the Android DevPhone 1). Clients (your laptop for example) can connect via wifi (ad-hoc mode)and get access to the internet using the 3G, 2G mobile connection which is established by the handset.

This application requires a "rooted"-device and(probably) a custom-kernel which supports netfilter (iptables)! Please see the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/wiki/FAQ) for detailed information.

For support, please see the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/wiki/FAQ) or our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/android-wifi-tether). Also, consider **[donating](https://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/wiki/Donate)** if you enjoy the product.

Use this application at your own risk. It is possible that use of this program may violate your carrier's Terms of Service.
